rss2jira
========

This is just a Python script that polls RSS feeds, monitoring for certain
keywords and then creating a JIRA issue if matched.  We use ``rss2jira`` to help
ensure we are answering questions about our software on community sites such as
Biostar and SEQanswers.

See ``rss2jira/rss2jira.conf.example`` for an example configuration.

There is also an example Puppet module and manifest on the ``puppet`` branch.
